    "**f-strings** were introduced in Python 3.6 (release date: Dec 2016) as a way to improve the readability of placing variables in strings. Up until this point in the course, we've always defined strings using either \" \" or ' '. An f-string declaration is easy to remember: you put an f in front of the normal string definition. Let's see some examples. "
